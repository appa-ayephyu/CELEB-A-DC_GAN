# CELEB-A-DC_GAN

The Celeb A 64x64 contains the entire celeb A dataset resized to 64x64. 
The DC GAN was trained without cropping and aligning to see how far the model is robust to the background data.

prepForTorch.py could be used for resizing the original Celeb A data to 64x64.

The PyTorch Library was used to build and Train the model.

Following are the fixed outputs from the Network.
